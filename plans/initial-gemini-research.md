# Architecting a Secure, High-Performance WordPress API Client with Bun.js and Server-Sent Events

## Part I: Securely Architecting the WordPress REST API Connection

The cornerstone of any client-side library that interacts with remote APIs is a secure and robust connection strategy. For a public JavaScript package designed to communicate with the WordPress REST API, this is not merely a feature but a foundational requirement. The following analysis will dissect the available authentication methods for the WordPress REST API, expose their inherent security risks when implemented directly on the client, and present a definitive, modern architectural pattern that mitigates these risks while providing a scalable foundation for future development.

### Section 1: A Comparative Analysis of WordPress REST API Authentication Methods

To make an informed architectural decision, it is crucial to evaluate the primary authentication methods available for the WordPress REST API. Each method presents a different set of trade-offs regarding security, implementation complexity, and user experience. A thorough understanding of these trade-offs is essential before writing any code.

#### 1.1 Application Passwords (Leveraging Basic Authentication)

Application Passwords are a core feature of WordPress designed to provide a mechanism for third-party applications to authenticate with the REST API without using a user's primary password.[1, 2] These passwords are 24-character, randomly generated alphanumeric strings that a user can create and revoke from their profile page.[2, 3]

Technically, Application Passwords utilize the HTTP Basic Authentication scheme. This involves sending an `Authorization` header with every request. The value of this header is the word `Basic` followed by a space and a Base64-encoded string of the format `username:application_password`.[3, 4]

A direct, client-side implementation in JavaScript would look as follows:

```javascript
// WARNING: This pattern is INSECURE for public client-side applications.
const username = 'wordpress_user';
const appPassword = 'abcd EFGH 1234 ijkl MNOP 6789'; // An example application password

// The btoa() function creates the Base64-encoded string.
const credentials = btoa(`${username}:${appPassword}`);

fetch('[https://your-wordpress-site.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/123](https://your-wordpress-site.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/123)', {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Basic ${credentials}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: 'Updated Title'
  })
}).then(response => {
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
  }
  return response.json();
}).then(data => {
  console.log('Post updated successfully:', data);
});
```

While this code is functionally correct [5], it harbors a critical security flaw when used in a public JavaScript package. The username and Application Password are hardcoded directly into the client-side code. This means that any user who visits a site using this package can simply view the page source or inspect network traffic to retrieve these credentials.[6] Exposing credentials in this manner is a fundamental violation of web security best practices.[7, 8, 9] Once compromised, an attacker could use these credentials to perform any action permitted by the associated user's role, leading to potential data theft, content manipulation, or site defacement. Therefore, this method is only suitable for server-to-server communication or within a trusted environment where the source code is not publicly accessible.

#### 1.2 OAuth 2.0 (Delegated Authorization)

OAuth 2.0 is an industry-standard protocol designed for delegated authorization. It allows an application to obtain limited access to a user's account on an HTTP service without exposing the user's password to the application.[10, 11, 12] For self-hosted WordPress sites, implementing OAuth 2.0 typically requires installing a server plugin, such as the one provided by the `WP-API` organization or a third-party alternative.[13, 14] For sites connected to WordPress.com, the functionality is provided via Jetpack.[15]

For purely client-side JavaScript applications that cannot securely store a `client_secret`, the prescribed OAuth 2.0 flow is the "Implicit Grant" flow.[15, 16] This process works as follows:
1.  The application redirects the user to the WordPress site's authorization endpoint with specific query parameters, including the `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, and `response_type=token`.
2.  The user logs into their WordPress site (if not already) and is presented with a consent screen asking them to authorize the application.
3.  Upon granting permission, the WordPress site redirects the user back to the application's specified `redirect_uri`. The `access_token` is included in the URL as a hash fragment (e.g., `https://yourapp.com/callback#access_token=...`).
4.  The client-side JavaScript then parses this token from the URL fragment.
5.  This access token is then used for all subsequent API requests by including it in the `Authorization: Bearer ` header.[16, 17]

While this flow avoids handling the user's password directly, the Implicit Grant is an older OAuth 2.0 pattern that is now generally discouraged for new applications. Its primary security weakness is the exposure of the access token directly in the browser's URL and, consequently, in the browser's history and potentially in server logs.[18] This increases the risk of the token being leaked. Modern security standards recommend the "Authorization Code Flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)" for public clients, which provides greater security but is more complex to implement.

#### 1.3 JSON Web Tokens (JWT) (Token-Based Authentication)

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.[10] It is important to distinguish that JWT is a token *format*, whereas OAuth is an authorization *protocol*.[19] In the context of the WordPress REST API, JWT authentication is enabled via a plugin, such as "JWT Authentication for WP REST API" or a similar offering.[20, 21, 22]

The typical authentication flow with a JWT plugin is:
1.  The client application sends a `POST` request containing the user's WordPress username and password to a special token endpoint provided by the plugin (e.g., `/wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/token`).[23]
2.  The server validates these credentials. If they are correct, it generates a signed JWT and returns it to the client.
3.  The client stores this JWT and includes it in the `Authorization: Bearer ` header for all subsequent requests to protected API endpoints.[24, 25]
4.  The server validates the signature of the JWT on each incoming request to authenticate the user.

This approach suffers from the same fundamental security vulnerability as using Application Passwords directly from the client: it requires the JavaScript application to handle the user's primary credentials (username and password) to obtain the initial token.[23] Transmitting and handling user passwords in client-side JavaScript is highly insecure and should be avoided at all costs.

#### 1.4 Architectural Decision Point

The analysis of these three authentication methods reveals a critical, unifying pattern: all client-side implementations either expose long-term credentials directly in the code or require the handling of sensitive information (user passwords, access tokens in URLs) in the browser, which is an insecure environment. The common mechanism for authenticated requests is the `Authorization` header, whether it's `Basic` or `Bearer`. The fundamental problem is that a public client application cannot be trusted to securely store the secrets required to generate this header.

This leads to an unavoidable architectural conclusion: a secure system must abstract the authentication process away from the client entirely. The client should never possess the Application Password, the client secret for OAuth, or the user's password for JWT. This makes the adoption of a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) proxy pattern not just a "best practice" but a mandatory requirement for building a secure and modern WordPress API client package.

| Authentication Method | How It Works | Pros | Cons / Security Risks (Client-Side) | Recommended Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Application Passwords** | User generates a password in WP admin. Client sends `username:app_password` via Basic Auth header.[3] | Simple to generate and use.[2] Core WordPress feature, no plugin needed. | **Critical Risk:** Credentials must be stored in client-side code, making them publicly visible.[6] | **Server-to-Server communication only.** Unsuitable for public clients. |
| **OAuth 2.0 (Implicit Flow)** | User is redirected to WP to grant access. An access token is returned in the URL fragment.[15, 16] | Standardized protocol for delegated access.[10] Does not handle user's password. | **High Risk:** Access token is exposed in the browser URL and history.[18] Older, less secure OAuth flow. | Third-party applications where a user explicitly grants access. The security risks must be understood and mitigated. |
| **JWT (via Plugin)** | Client sends `username:password` to a token endpoint to receive a JWT. JWT is used in Bearer header.[23] | Stateless and self-contained tokens.[10] Flexible and widely used format. | **Critical Risk:** Requires the client to handle the user's primary password to get the initial token. | Headless applications where the "client" is a trusted server-side application, not a public browser. |

### Section 2: The Definitive Strategy: A Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Proxy

Given the security vulnerabilities inherent in direct client-side authentication with the WordPress REST API, the only robust and secure architectural solution is to introduce a trusted intermediary. This section provides a detailed blueprint for implementing a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) proxy server using the Bun.js runtime. This architecture not only solves the immediate security challenges but also provides a strategic foundation for future scalability and functionality.

#### 2.1 The Cardinal Rule: Zero Credentials on the Client

The most important principle in modern client-side application security is to never store secrets in code that runs in a user's browser.[7, 8] API keys, application passwords, and any other credentials must be kept on a secure server. The client-side JavaScript package should be designed from the outset with this non-negotiable constraint in mind. It will not know how to authenticate; it will only know how to talk to a trusted server that authenticates on its behalf.

#### 2.2 Architectural Blueprint: The Bun.js BFF Proxy

The BFF pattern introduces a lightweight server that sits between the client-side application and the backend services (in this case, the WordPress REST API). The request flow is fundamentally altered to enhance security:

1.  The client-side JavaScript package (the MCP) makes all its API requests to the Bun.js BFF server, not directly to the WordPress site.
2.  The Bun.js BFF server, running in a secure environment, receives the request. It holds the WordPress Application Password, which is loaded securely from environment variables, not from code.[9]
3.  The BFF server constructs the necessary `Authorization` header (e.g., `Basic...`) and forwards, or "proxies," the original request to the correct WordPress REST API endpoint.
4.  The WordPress site receives the authenticated request from the trusted BFF server and processes it.
5.  WordPress sends its response back to the BFF server.
6.  The BFF server streams the response back to the original client.

Bun.js is exceptionally well-suited for this task. Its core features include a high-performance, built-in HTTP server (`Bun.serve`) and native support for TypeScript and modern JavaScript features.[26] This allows for the creation of an extremely fast and efficient proxy server with minimal code and no external framework dependencies like Express or Fastify, reducing complexity and potential attack surface.[27, 28]

#### 2.3 Implementation Guide: Building the BFF with Bun

Building the BFF proxy is straightforward with Bun. The following guide provides a production-ready implementation.

**1. Project Setup and Credential Management**

First, initialize a new Bun project for the server.

```bash
mkdir mcp-bff-server && cd mcp-bff-server
bun init -y
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root to store the sensitive credentials. This file should be added to `.gitignore` to prevent it from ever being committed to version control.[9]

```
#.env
WP_URL="[https://your-wordpress-site.com](https://your-wordpress-site.com)"
WP_USER="your-wp-user"
WP_APP_PASSWORD="your application password here"
```

Bun automatically loads environment variables from `.env` files, making them accessible via `process.env` or `Bun.env`.[29]

**2. Proxy Server Implementation**

Create an `index.ts` file and implement the proxy logic. This server will listen for requests, attach the authentication header, and forward them to the WordPress API.

```typescript
// mcp-bff-server/index.ts

const WP_URL = Bun.env.WP_URL;
const WP_USER = Bun.env.WP_USER;
const WP_APP_PASSWORD = Bun.env.WP_APP_PASSWORD;

if (!WP_URL ||!WP_USER ||!WP_APP_PASSWORD) {
  console.error("Missing required WordPress environment variables.");
  process.exit(1);
}

// Pre-calculate the authorization header value.
const authHeaderValue = `Basic ${Buffer.from(`${WP_USER}:${WP_APP_PASSWORD}`).toString('base64')}`;

console.log(`BFF Proxy starting. Forwarding requests to ${WP_URL}`);

Bun.serve({
  async fetch(req: Request): Promise {
    const requestUrl = new URL(req.url);

    // Construct the target URL for the WordPress REST API.
    // This forwards the path and query parameters from the client request.
    const targetUrl = new URL(requestUrl.pathname + requestUrl.search, WP_URL);

    // Create a new headers object to avoid modifying the original.
    // Forward most headers from the incoming request.
    const forwardedHeaders = new Headers();
    for (const [key, value] of req.headers.entries()) {
      // Exclude headers that should not be forwarded.
      if (!['host', 'connection'].includes(key.toLowerCase())) {
        forwardedHeaders.append(key, value);
      }
    }

    // Add the secure Authorization header.
    forwardedHeaders.set('Authorization', authHeaderValue);

    try {
      // Make the proxied request to the WordPress API.
      const response = await fetch(targetUrl.toString(), {
        method: req.method,
        headers: forwardedHeaders,
        body: req.body,
        redirect: 'follow' // Handle redirects if any.
      });
      
      // Return the response from WordPress directly to the client.
      // This creates a new Response to ensure headers like CORS can be added.
      return new Response(response.body, {
        status: response.status,
        statusText: response.statusText,
        headers: response.headers
      });

    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Proxy request failed:', error);
      return new Response('Proxy error', { status: 502 });
    }
  },
  port: 3001, // The port your client-side MCP will connect to.
  error(error: Error): Response {
    console.error("Unhandled error in BFF:", error);
    return new Response("Internal Server Error", { status: 500 });
  },
});
```

This architecture provides a significant strategic advantage beyond just security. The BFF server becomes a centralized control point for all API interactions. It can be extended to implement server-side caching to reduce the load on the WordPress database [30], enforce rate limiting to prevent abuse [31], aggregate data from multiple API endpoints into a single response, or transform data before sending it to the client. Most importantly, this BFF server is the ideal location to host the Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint for the planned real-time service, creating a unified and scalable backend for the entire product ecosystem. Adopting this pattern now for security reasons lays the perfect groundwork for future expansion.

## Part II: Building and Publishing the MCP Package with Bun.js

With a secure connection architecture established, the focus now shifts to the development of the client-side JavaScript package itself. This part provides a comprehensive guide to scaffolding, designing, implementing, and publishing the library using the modern and efficient Bun.js toolkit.

### Section 3: Scaffolding a Professional-Grade TypeScript Library

A well-structured project is easier to maintain, test, and contribute to. This section outlines the best practices for setting up the library's foundation.

#### 3.1 Project Initialization with `bun init`

The Bun CLI provides an interactive command, `bun init`, to quickly scaffold a new project.[29, 32] It generates the essential configuration files with sensible defaults. For this project, a TypeScript setup is recommended.

```bash
mkdir mcp-client-js && cd mcp-client-js
bun init
```

Follow the interactive prompts, specifying `src/index.ts` as the entry point. This will create a `package.json`, a `tsconfig.json` configured for Bun, an `index.ts` file, a `.gitignore` file, and initialize a Git repository.

#### 3.2 Recommended Project Structure

Adopting a clean, conventional project structure from the start is crucial for long-term maintainability, especially if the project might evolve into a monorepo with multiple packages.[33] The following structure separates concerns logically:

```
mcp-client-js/
├── dist/                # Bundled output files (generated by build process)
├── src/                 # Source code
│   ├── index.ts         # Main package entry point, exports the client
│   ├── client.ts        # The core MCPClient class implementation
│   ├── types.ts         # Shared TypeScript type definitions for API objects
│   └── endpoints/       # Directory for API endpoint handlers
│       ├── posts.ts     # Methods for interacting with the /posts endpoint
│       └── users.ts     # Methods for interacting with the /users endpoint
├── tests/               # Test files
│   └── client.test.ts   # Tests for the MCPClient
├──.gitignore
├── bun.lockb            # Bun's lockfile
├── package.json         # Project metadata and scripts
├── tsconfig.json        # TypeScript configuration
└── README.md
```

This structure clearly separates source code from tests and build artifacts. Grouping endpoint-specific logic into its own directory (`src/endpoints/`) keeps the main `client.ts` file clean and makes it easier to add support for new custom endpoints from your WordPress plugins in the future.

#### 3.3 Configuring `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`

The `package.json` file is the heart of the project's metadata. It should be configured to support modern JavaScript environments.

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "@your-scope/mcp-client",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A modern JavaScript client for My WordPress Plugin's REST API.",
  "type": "module",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "module": "dist/index.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "import": "./dist/index.js",
      "require": "./dist/index.js",
      "types": "./dist/index.d.ts"
    }
  },
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "bun --watch src/index.ts",
    "build": "bun build./src/index.ts --outdir./dist --target browser",
    "test": "bun test",
    "lint": "eslint. --ext.ts"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.0.0",
    "@types/bun": "latest"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.0.0"
  }
}
```
The `exports` field is particularly important for ensuring proper module resolution in both CommonJS (`require`) and ESM (`import`) environments.[33]

The `tsconfig.json` file controls how TypeScript compiles the code. For a library, it's crucial to enable strict type checking and to generate declaration files (`.d.ts`) so that consumers of the package get full type safety and editor autocompletion.

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": [],
    "module": "ESNext",
    "target": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "declaration": true,
    "outDir": "./dist"
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts"]
}
```

### Section 4: Core Library Design and Implementation

The core of the package is the client class that developers will use to interact with the API. It should have a clean, intuitive, and extensible design.

#### 4.1 Designing the `MCPClient` Class

A class-based approach provides a clear and stateful way to manage the connection to the BFF server. This pattern is common in API client libraries, such as `node-wpapi` [34], and will be familiar to many developers. The constructor will take the URL of the BFF proxy as its only argument.

```typescript
// src/client.ts
import { PostsEndpoint } from './endpoints/posts';

export class MCPClient {
  private readonly bffUrl: string;
  public readonly posts: PostsEndpoint;

  constructor(bffUrl: string) {
    if (!bffUrl) {
      throw new Error('BFF server URL is required.');
    }
    // Ensure the URL does not have a trailing slash to simplify path joining.
    this.bffUrl = bffUrl.endsWith('/')? bffUrl.slice(0, -1) : bffUrl;
    
    // Instantiate endpoint handlers
    this.posts = new PostsEndpoint(this.bffUrl);
  }
}
```

This design uses composition, where each set of related endpoints is managed by its own class (e.g., `PostsEndpoint`), making the main client class a clean entry point.

#### 4.2 Implementing Type-Safe Endpoint Methods

Each endpoint handler class will contain methods that correspond to specific API actions (`GET`, `POST`, etc.). Using TypeScript generics allows these methods to be strongly typed, providing an excellent developer experience.

```typescript
// src/types.ts
export interface WP_Post {
  id: number;
  date: string;
  status: 'publish' | 'draft' | 'private';
  title: {
    rendered: string;
  };
  content: {
    rendered: string;
  };
  //... other post properties
}

// src/endpoints/posts.ts
import type { WP_Post } from '../types';
import { handleApiResponse } from '../utils'; // A utility for error handling

export class PostsEndpoint {
  private readonly baseUrl: string;

  constructor(bffUrl: string) {
    this.baseUrl = `${bffUrl}/wp-json/wp/v2/posts`;
  }

  public async getAll(): Promise {
    const response = await fetch(this.baseUrl);
    return handleApiResponse(response);
  }

  public async getById(id: number): Promise {
    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/${id}`);
    return handleApiResponse(response);
  }

  public async create(data: Partial>): Promise {
    const response = await fetch(this.baseUrl, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    });
    return handleApiResponse(response);
  }
}
```

#### 4.3 Robust Error Handling

A production-grade library must provide clear and actionable error information. A utility function can standardize error handling across all API calls. It should check if the `fetch` response was successful and, if not, parse the error message from the API and throw a custom error.

```typescript
// src/utils.ts
export class ApiError extends Error {
  constructor(public status: number, public statusText: string, public data: any) {
    super(`API Error: ${status} ${statusText}`);
    this.name = 'ApiError';
  }
}

export async function handleApiResponse(response: Response): Promise {
  if (!response.ok) {
    let errorData;
    try {
      errorData = await response.json();
    } catch {
      errorData = { message: 'Failed to parse error response.' };
    }
    throw new ApiError(response.status, response.statusText, errorData);
  }
  return response.json() as Promise;
}
```
This ensures that any consumer of the library can use a standard `try...catch` block to gracefully handle API failures and inspect the status and body of the error response.

### Section 5: The Bun.js Publishing Workflow

Once the library is implemented, Bun provides an integrated toolchain to test, bundle, and publish it to a package registry like npm.

#### 5.1 Testing with `bun test`

Bun includes a fast, Jest-compatible test runner out of the box.[29, 35, 36] Writing tests is essential to ensure the client works as expected and to prevent regressions.

```typescript
// tests/client.test.ts
import { expect, test, mock } from 'bun:test';
import { MCPClient } from '../src/client';
import { WP_Post } from '../src/types';

// Mock the global fetch function
global.fetch = mock(async (url: string | URL | Request) => {
  if (url.toString().endsWith('/posts')) {
    const mockPost: WP_Post = { id: 1, date: '2025-01-01T00:00:00', status: 'publish', title: { rendered: 'Test Post' }, content: { rendered: 'Test Content' } };
    return new Response(JSON.stringify([mockPost]));
  }
  return new Response('Not Found', { status: 404 });
});

test('MCPClient should fetch all posts', async () => {
  const client = new MCPClient('http://localhost:3001');
  const posts = await client.posts.getAll();
  
  expect(posts).toBeArray();
  expect(posts.length).toBe(1);
  expect(posts[0].id).toBe(1);
  expect(global.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledWith('http://localhost:3001/wp-json/wp/v2/posts');
});
```
Running `bun test` will execute these tests and provide a report.

#### 5.2 Bundling for Production with `bun build`

Before publishing, the TypeScript source code must be compiled and bundled into distributable JavaScript files. The `bun build` command handles this efficiently, performing transpilation, bundling, and minification.[37]

```bash
bun build ./src/index.ts --outdir ./dist --target browser --sourcemap
```
This command will take the main entry point, bundle all its dependencies into a single file (or multiple if code splitting is used), and place the output in the `dist` directory. The `--target browser` flag ensures the output is compatible with web browsers, and `--sourcemap` generates source maps for easier debugging in production.

#### 5.3 Publishing to the NPM Registry with `bun publish`

Finally, the `bun publish` command is used to publish the package to the npm registry.[38]

Before publishing, ensure you are logged into npm via the CLI (`npm login`). Then, run the command from the project root.

```bash
bun publish --access public
```

The `--access public` flag is necessary if publishing a scoped package (e.g., `@your-scope/mcp-client`) to the public registry for the first time.[38] For verification before a real publish, the `--dry-run` flag is invaluable. For automated CI/CD pipelines, authentication can be configured using an `.npmrc` file or environment variables.[39]

## Part III: Evolving to a Real-Time Service with Server-Sent Events (SSE)

This final part of the report addresses the forward-looking goal of creating a small service to empower users with real-time connections to their WordPress sites. It demonstrates how the BFF architecture established in Part I can be seamlessly extended to support this functionality using Server-Sent Events (SSE).

### Section 6: Fundamentals of Server-Sent Events

Server-Sent Events provide a standardized, efficient way for a server to push data to a client over a single, long-lived HTTP connection.

#### 6.1 SSE vs. WebSockets

While WebSockets provide full-duplex (two-way) communication, SSE is a simpler, unidirectional (server-to-client) protocol built directly on top of standard HTTP.[40, 41] For use cases that only require the server to send updates to the client, such as notifications or live data feeds, SSE is often a better choice for several reasons:
* **Simplicity:** The protocol and client-side implementation are less complex than WebSockets.
* **HTTP-Based:** It uses a standard HTTP connection, so it works with existing infrastructure (proxies, firewalls) without requiring connection upgrades.[42]
* **Automatic Reconnection:** A key feature of the `EventSource` browser API is that it will automatically attempt to reconnect to the server if the connection is lost, making it highly resilient to network interruptions.[41] This behavior must be manually implemented when using WebSockets.

#### 6.2 The `text/event-stream` Format

The data format for SSE is a simple text stream encoded in UTF-8. Messages are separated by a pair of newlines, and each message can have several fields [43]:
* `data:`: The payload of the message. Multiple `data` lines can be sent for a single event.
* `event:`: An optional name for the event. If not provided, the event is dispatched as a generic `message` event on the client.
* `id:`: An optional unique ID for the event. If the client disconnects, it will send the last received ID in a `Last-Event-ID` header upon reconnection, allowing the server to resume the stream from where it left off.
* `retry:`: An optional integer specifying how many milliseconds the client should wait before attempting to reconnect after a lost connection.

### Section 7: Building a High-Performance SSE Server with Bun

The BFF server is the perfect place to host the SSE endpoint. This section details how to add this functionality.

#### 7.1 The `better-sse` Library

While it is possible to implement an SSE endpoint from scratch, a library like `better-sse` provides a robust, feature-rich, and spec-compliant solution that simplifies the process. It is compatible with all popular HTTP frameworks, including the native server in Bun, and offers features like channels for broadcasting, event batching, and keep-alive pings.[40, 44]

First, add the library to the BFF server project:
```bash
bun add better-sse
```

#### 7.2 Implementing the SSE Endpoint in the BFF

The SSE endpoint can be added as a new route within the existing `Bun.serve` configuration. The `better-sse` library provides a `createResponse` utility that seamlessly integrates with Fetch API-based servers like Bun's.

A powerful feature of `better-sse` is the concept of "channels," which allow you to broadcast a single event to multiple connected clients simultaneously.[40] This is a highly scalable pattern for a service that will serve many users.

```typescript
// mcp-bff-server/index.ts
import { createResponse, createChannel } from 'better-sse';

//... (existing proxy setup code)...

// Create a global channel to broadcast events to all connected clients.
const sseChannel = createChannel();

console.log(`BFF Proxy and SSE Server starting on port 3001...`);

Bun.serve({
  async fetch(req: Request): Promise {
    const requestUrl = new URL(req.url);

    // Route for the SSE connection
    if (requestUrl.pathname === '/sse-connect') {
      const session = await createResponse(req);
      sseChannel.register(session);
      console.log(`Client connected to SSE. Total clients: ${sseChannel.sessions.size}`);

      // When the client disconnects, unregister them.
      req.signal.addEventListener("abort", () => {
        sseChannel.deregister(session);
        console.log(`Client disconnected. Total clients: ${sseChannel.sessions.size}`);
      });
      
      return session.response;
    }
    
    // Example route to trigger a broadcast to all SSE clients
    if (requestUrl.pathname === '/broadcast-update' && req.method === 'POST') {
      const body = await req.json();
      sseChannel.broadcast({ data: body, event: 'wp-update' }); // Send data with a custom event name
      return new Response(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Broadcast sent.' }), { status: 200 });
    }

    //... (existing proxy logic for other routes)...
  },
  //... (port and error handler)...
});
```
In this example, clients connect to `/sse-connect` to establish the event stream. A separate endpoint, `/broadcast-update`, could be called by a WordPress webhook (or another mechanism) to trigger an event that is then pushed in real-time to all connected clients.

### Section 8: Integrating the Client and Server

The final step is to enable the client-side MCP package to consume the SSE stream from the BFF server.

#### 8.1 Client-Side `EventSource` API

The browser provides a native `EventSource` interface for connecting to an SSE endpoint. It is simple to use and handles reconnection automatically.[41, 43] This functionality can be wrapped in a method within the `MCPClient` class.

```typescript
// src/client.ts

//... (inside the MCPClient class)...

/**
 * Establishes a real-time connection to the server for updates.
 * @param onUpdate A callback function to execute when an update is received.
 * @returns A function that can be called to close the connection.
 */
public connectToUpdates(onUpdate: (data: any) => void): () => void {
  const eventSource = new EventSource(`${this.bffUrl}/sse-connect`);

  // Listen for custom 'wp-update' events from the server
  eventSource.addEventListener('wp-update', (event) => {
    try {
      const eventData = JSON.parse(event.data);
      onUpdate(eventData);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to parse SSE event data:', error);
    }
  });

  // Handle generic messages
  eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
    console.log('Received generic SSE message:', event.data);
  };

  eventSource.onerror = (err) => {
    // The browser will automatically try to reconnect.
    // You can add specific logic here if needed, e.g., updating UI state.
    console.error("EventSource connection error:", err);
  };

  // Return a cleanup function to allow the consumer to close the connection.
  return () => {
    eventSource.close();
  };
}
```

#### 8.2 End-to-End Example

This final example ties together all parts of the report, showing how a developer would use the finished `mcp-client-js` package to perform a standard API request and then subscribe to real-time updates.

```javascript
import { MCPClient } from '@your-scope/mcp-client';

// 1. Instantiate the client, pointing it to the BFF server.
const client = new MCPClient('http://localhost:3001');

// 2. Define a callback function to handle real-time updates.
const handleRealtimeUpdate = (updateData) => {
  console.log('Real-time update received!', updateData);
  // Here, you would update your application's UI, e.g., refresh a list of posts.
};

// 3. Make a standard API call to fetch initial data.
async function fetchInitialPosts() {
  try {
    const posts = await client.posts.getAll();
    console.log('Fetched initial posts:', posts);
    // Render these posts in the UI.
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch posts:', error);
  }
}

// 4. Start listening for real-time updates.
const closeConnection = client.connectToUpdates(handleRealtimeUpdate);
console.log('Listening for real-time updates from WordPress...');

// 5. Fetch the initial data.
fetchInitialPosts();

// Later, if the component unmounts or the user navigates away:
// closeConnection();
```
This demonstrates a complete, modern, and secure workflow, providing a powerful and practical blueprint for the development agent.

## Conclusion

This report outlines a comprehensive strategy for developing a modern, secure, and high-performance JavaScript package for interacting with custom WordPress REST APIs. The analysis concludes that direct client-side authentication presents unacceptable security risks, making a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) proxy architecture a mandatory component. By leveraging the Bun.js runtime, this secure proxy can be implemented with remarkable efficiency and performance.

The recommended architecture provides several key advantages:
* **Enhanced Security:** Credentials are never exposed to the client, mitigating the primary risk vector for public JavaScript applications interacting with authenticated APIs.
* **Scalability and Extensibility:** The BFF server acts as a strategic control point for future enhancements, such as caching, rate-limiting, and data transformation.
* **Future-Proof Design:** The architecture seamlessly accommodates the planned evolution into a real-time service using Server-Sent Events, with the BFF server hosting the SSE endpoint for a unified backend.
* **Modern Developer Experience:** The entire stack, from the Bun-based BFF to the TypeScript client library and the SSE implementation, utilizes modern tools and best practices, resulting in a more maintainable and performant system.

By following this blueprint, the resulting MCP package and its accompanying service will not only be functionally robust but will also adhere to the high standards of security and performance expected of modern web applications. The provided code examples and structural recommendations offer a clear and actionable path for development.
